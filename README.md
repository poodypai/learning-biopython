# Learning Biopython

This repository contains the code I write while learning Biopython. It is mainly for practicing Python in a bioinformatics context

## About

Biopython is a Python library used for biological computation. Some of the things you can do with it are:

- Working with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences  
- Reading and writing files like FASTA and GenBank  
- Getting data from online databases like NCBI  
- Doing basic bioinformatics calculations  
- Creating simple phylogenetic trees  

This repo is where I try out these things while improving my skills in coding and bioinformatics.
